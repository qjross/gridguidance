I don't know if we even need this, but I'm pushing it to the repo anyway

Yeah, we do.

One thing - use the Grid logo to trigger the dropdown to switch from guidance to best practices
Got that 1/19, now to make it dramatically less janky

I have a SASS version of the CSS in the repo; don't call to it yet.

This uses Florian Karsten's Space Grotesk font: https://github.com/floriankarsten/space-grotesk/releases

Again, us 3 know this already. If we have another Cover 0 in Grid like we did 1/19 AM...

There was. 

I included that opening jumbotron because I got pissed at seeing GRID still up and running when Chris couldn't close last week. I swear, they need to start learning how they're going to handle Cover 0s in GRID because this is fucking ridiculous. 

CHRIS GOT US A PRINTER SET UP - NOBODY CAN TELL US SHIT AT THIS POINT

Well, we have a new RSM. I swear, if he's another manager with as little tech savvy as the rest of management, we're fucked.
