I don't know if we even need this, but I'm pushing it to the repo anyway

Yeah, we do.

One thing - use the Grid logo to trigger the dropdown to switch from guidance to best practices
Got that 1/19, now to make it dramatically less janky

Quinten J. Ross.

I have a SASS version of the CSS in the repo; don't call to it yet.

This uses Florian Karsten's Space Grotesk font: https://github.com/floriankarsten/space-grotesk/releases

Again, us 3 know this already. If we have another Cover 0 in Grid like we did 1/19 AM...

There was. 

I included that opening jumbotron because I got pissed at seeing GRID still up and running when Chris couldn't close last week. I swear, starting with this new member of management, they better start fucking learning how they're going to handle Cover 0s because if their only ideas are "run one of us into the ground" or "ignore it entirely when none of us are here," we're fucked. If Jonathan isn't on baseline GRID level, we're fucked.

CHRIS GOT US A PRINTER SET UP

Between Chris getting us a printer, me coding this guidance, and Jacob refurbishing older desktops with Linux distros, nobody can tell us jack or shit.
